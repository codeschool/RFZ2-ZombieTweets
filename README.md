Rails for Zombies 2 App
=======================

This app is a mixup of all the code in the Slides combined with all the Code in the Challenges.  It's admittedly a bit of a mutt, but hopefully it will prove useful if you want to start playing around with a Rails app.

However, if you want to start building you own application, you're best starting from scratch.

To get this running you'll want to run
--------------------------------------

1. Run bundle

   bundle

2. Migrate your database
  
   rake db:migrate
   
3. Start your server

   rails server

Duh right?
